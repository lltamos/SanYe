                <h4>2.2 <u>Access Through a CS</u>.</h4>
                <p>If you access the Company Properties through a CS as part of the functionality of the Website, the

                    conditions that govern your use of each Third-Party Account.  You represent that you are entitled to
                    disclose your Third-Party Account login information to Company and/or grant Company access to your
                    Third-Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein)

                    usage limitations imposed by such third-party service providers.  By granting Company access to any
                    Third-Party Accounts, you understand that Company may access, make available and store (if
                    applicable) any information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video,

                    (<strong>“Content”</strong>) that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account
                    (<strong>“CS Content”</strong>) so that it is available on and through Company Properties via your
                    Account.  Unless otherwise specified in the Terms, all CS Content shall be considered to be Your
                    Content (as defined in Section 3.1) for all purposes of the Terms.  Depending on the Third-Party
                    Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third-Party
                    Accounts, personally identifiable information that you post to your Third-Party Accounts may be
                    available on and through your Account on Company Properties. Please note that if a Third-Party
                    Account or associated service becomes unavailable or Company’s access to such Third-Party Account is
                    terminated by the third-party service provider, then CS Content will no longer be available on and
                    through Company Properties.  You have the ability to disable the connection between your Account and
                    your Third-Party Accounts at any time by removing the Application from the CS.  PLEASE NOTE THAT
                    YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS
                    IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND COMPANY

                    THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS.  Company makes no effort to review any CS Content for any purpose, including
                    but not limited to, for accuracy, legality or noninfringement, and Company is not responsible for
                    any CS Content.</p>

                    proceeding with any transaction with any third party.</p>
                <h4>8.2 <u>App Stores</u>.</h4>
                <p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application and the Services is dependent on
                    the third party from whom you received the Application license, e.g., the Slack App Directory or
                    similar app directory, store, or marketplace (<strong>“App Store”</strong>).  You acknowledge that
                    the Terms are between you and Company and not with the App Store.  Company, not the App Store, is
                    solely responsible for Company Properties, including the Application, the content thereof,
                    maintenance, support services, and warranty therefor, and addressing any claims relating thereto
                    (e.g., product liability, legal compliance or intellectual property infringement).  You also agree
                    to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with Company Properties, including
                    the Application.  You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned
                    upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s
                    terms and policies) when using Company Properties, including the Application. You acknowledge that
                    the App Store (and its subsidiaries) may be third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the
                    right to enforce them.</p>
                <h3>9. Fees and Purchase Terms.</h3>
                <h4>9.1 <u>General Purpose of Terms: Sale of Service, not Software</u>.</h4>
                <p>The purpose of the Terms is for you to secure access to the Services.  All fees set forth within and
                    paid by you under the Terms shall be considered solely in furtherance of this purpose.  In no way
                    are these fees paid considered payment for the sale, license, or use of Company’s Software, and,
                    furthermore, any use of Company’s Software by you in furtherance of the Terms will be considered
                    merely in support of the purpose of the Terms.</p>
                <h4>9.2 <u>Payment</u>.</h4>
                <p>You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing
                    terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide Company with a
                    valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) (<strong>“Payment
                        Provider”</strong>), or purchase order information as a condition to signing up for the
                    Services.  Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you
                    must refer to that agreement and not the Terms to determine your rights and liabilities.  By
                    providing Company with your credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that
                    Company is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable
                    to Company hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You agree to immediately
                    notify Company of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder. 
                    Company reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately
                    upon posting on Company Properties or by e-mail delivery to you.</p>
                <h4>9.3 <u>Service Subscription Fees</u>.</h4>
                <p>You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a <strong>“Service
                    Subscription Fee”</strong>) at the time you create your Account and select your annual package
                    (each, a <strong>“Service Commencement Date”</strong>).  Except as set forth in the Terms, all fees
                    for the Services are non-refundable.  No contract will exist between you and Company for the
                    Services until Company accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other
                    appropriate means of communication.</p>
                <h4>9.4 <u>Taxes</u>.</h4>
                <p>Company’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax.  If any Services, or payments for any Services,
                    under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the
                    applicable Sales Tax to Company, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any
                    related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Company for any
                    liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes.  Upon our request, you will
                    provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence
                    that you have paid all applicable taxes.  For purposes of this section, <strong>“Sales Tax”</strong>
                    shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that Company is
                    permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the
                    applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.</p>
                <h4>9.5 <u>Withholding Taxes</u>.</h4>
                <p>You agree to make all payments of fees to Company free and clear of, and without reduction for, any
                    withholding taxes.  Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to Company will be your sole
                    responsibility, and you will provide Company with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing
                    authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have
                    been paid.</p>
                <h4>9.6 <u>Automatic Renewal</u>.</h4>
                <p>Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with the Terms.<strong> 
                    After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your
                    subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each a
                    “Renewal Commencement Date”) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at Company’s
                    then-current price for such subscription.  You agree that your Account will be subject to this
                    automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at least (a) thirty (30) days  prior
                    to the Renewal Commencement Date (or in the event that you receive a notice from Company that your
                    subscription will be automatically renewed, you will have thirty days from the date of the Company
                    notice), by contacting Company at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__"

                    If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current
                    subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. 
                    However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid
                    for the then-current subscription period.  By subscribing, you authorize Company to charge your
                    Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period.  Upon
                    renewal of your subscription, if Company does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i)
                    you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Company may
                    either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment
                    Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment,  your Account will be activated and for
                    purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day
                    payment was received).</p>

                    used within the specified time of the trial.  At the end of the trial period, your use of that
                    Service will expire and any further use of the Service is prohibited unless you pay the applicable
                    subscription fee.  If you are inadvertently charged for a subscription, please contact Company to
                    have the charges reversed.</p>
                <h4>9.8 <u>Advertising Revenue</u>.</h4>

                    them for you.  In addition, Company will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing
                    and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims
                    are frivolous.
                </p>
                <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in
                    person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the
                    award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <h4>17.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Authority of Arbitrator</span>.</h4>
                <p>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this
                    Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability,
                    enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim
                    that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide
                    the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Company.   The arbitration proceeding will not be
                    consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall
                    have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall
                    have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief
                    available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement
                    (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
                    decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including
                    the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
                    individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final
                    and binding upon you and us.</p>
                <h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">17.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. </span></h4>
                <p>YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL
                    IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Company are instead electing that all claims and disputes
                    shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section
                    17.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
                    and must follow this Agreement as a court would.   However, there is no judge or jury in
                    arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.</p>
                <h4>17.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</h4>
                <p>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN
                    INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND
                    CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY
                    OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of
                    any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, than the claim must be severed
                    from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York. 
                    All other claims shall be arbitrated.</p>

                <h3>18 General Provisions.</h3>
                <h4><u>18.1 Electronic Communications</u>.</h4>
                <p>The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you visit Company Properties
                    or send Company e-mails, or whether Company posts notices on Company Properties or communicates with
                    you via e-mail.  For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from Company in
                    an electronic form; and (2) agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures,
                    and other communications that Company provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement

                    websites of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of the Terms or your use of Company
                    Properties.  If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542,
                    which states, “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
                    suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have
                    materially affected his settlement with the debtor.  The foregoing release does not apply to any
                    claims, demands, or any losses, damages, rights and actions of any kind, including personal
                    injuries, death or property damage for any unconscionable commercial practice by a Company Party or

                <h4><u>18.11 Severability</u>.</h4>
                <p>If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in
                    a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining

                    list of prohibited or restricted parties. You also will not use Company Properties for any purpose
